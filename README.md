# Campaign Manager

This is a simple feedback collection app that I created with Node and React as part of [Stephen Grider's](https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development) Node with React course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).

*Tech stack:* React, Redux, Express, MongoDB (supported with Google OAuth authentication and Stripe)

Feel free to check it out at: http://campaigns-manager.herokuapp.com.

This is my first Node app!
